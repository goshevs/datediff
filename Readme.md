## Utilities for working with dates

The repo contains two programmes that help compute differences between dates. 

### Introduction

Working with dates in Stata is made easy using its built-in `datetime` functionality.
Yet, while it is straight forward to compute difference between dates in days, there is no easy way to compute
difference between dates in years, months and days, or years or months only. In addition, 
there is no easy way to calculate the date resulting from adding a specific number of months to a start date.
This package includes two functions that make such kinds of calculations.
